I am Melih. I was born in 2004 and now, I am a student at Hacettepe University. I like playing basketball and tennis.
Also, i play guitar in my free time.

I acknowledge that I have fully read and understood the contents of the course webiste; I will not share my work (not even a part of it)
on Piazza; I will be responsible for what has been discussed/asked on Piazza; I will not expect any response for my questions that have 
already been asked or written in a language other than English. I understand that if I have any questions or concerns about the course mechanics,
it is my responsibility to discuss them with the instructtors within their office hours.
